# Med-Buddy
This project is implemented through an app coded in Java, it's recommended to clone this repository and launch this code through the desktop.

## Objectives
1. Reducing the waiting period of patients in long OPD queues by the online slot booking system.
2. Provide them with knowledge of medical facilities available in hospitals and clinics.

## Motivation
Many times, patients suffer a loss as a result of long waiting lines in front of OPD, which not only wastes time but also causes a delay in diagnosis, so a solution to this problem is required.

## What we have built
We have developed an app that can cater to the needs of patients looking for information about the facilities available in a hospital/clinic, and also it can book scheduled slots for consultation and estimate approx. waiting at busy hours. 

## How to install and run
### Installation Requirements
1. Android Studio (any other alternative)
2. Java

If any of the three is not installed, then one must install them first.

To install Android Studio, click on https://developer.android.com/studio/install and then choose the required option to download the same. To install Java, click on https://www.java.com/en/download/help/windows_manual_download.html and then choose the required option to download.  


Once all of the requirements are fulfilled, then one can extract the source code and open the folder with Android Studio. In Android Studio, connect the app with firebase and then create an Android Virtual Device (AVD) that the emulator can use to install and run the app.
